# Data-Science-Jobs-and-Salaries-Analysis

Skills take away From This Projec:t	Python coding, Data Preprocessing, Visualization
Domain:	Recruitment Industry, Job portal, Job Posting

In this project, we will analyse data science jobs and salaries using Python to understand the following:
Analysis 1: What is the job with the highest salary in Data Science?
Analysis 2: What are the top 10 data science jobs in 2023?
Analysis 3: Does the salary of employees (salary_in_usd) depend on the experience level?
Analysis 4: How is the distribution of Data Science worker locations?
Analysis 5: What are the top 10 countries provide highest salary for data science jobs?
Analysis 6: What are the top 3 Jobs by Experience Level?
Analysis 7: Does the company size affect on salary given for data science jobs?
Analysis 8: Whether the number of Data Science jobs and salaries increase each year?!
Dataset
We extracted a dataset from a famous job portal that explains the job status of various data-related jobs posted during the year 2023.
The data explains the various job designations and related salaries from across the world. 
The dataset contains 5341 rows and  12 columns.

Data Description
work_year: The year in which the data was recorded. This field indicates the temporal context of the data, important for understanding salary trends over time.
job_title: The specific title of the job role, like 'Data Scientist', 'Data Engineer', or 'Data Analyst'. This column is crucial for understanding the salary distribution across various specialized roles within the data field.
job_category: A classification of the job role into broader categories for easier analysis. This might include areas like 'Data Analysis', 'Machine Learning', 'Data Engineering', etc.
salary_currency: The currency in which the salary is paid, such as USD, EUR, etc. This is important for currency conversion and understanding the actual value of the salary in a global context.
salary: The annual gross salary of the role in the local currency. This raw salary figure is key for direct regional salary comparisons.
salary_in_usd: The annual gross salary converted to United States Dollars (USD). This uniform currency conversion aids in global salary comparisons and analyses.
employee_residence: The country of residence of the employee. This data point can be used to explore geographical salary differences and cost-of-living variations.
experience_level: Classifies the professional experience level of the employee. Common categories might include 'Entry-level', 'Mid-level', 'Senior', and 'Executive', providing insight into how experience influences salary in data-related roles.
employment_type: Specifies the type of employment, such as 'Full-time', 'Part-time', 'Contract', etc. This helps in analyzing how different employment arrangements affect salary structures.
work_setting: The work setting or environment, like 'Remote', 'In-person', or 'Hybrid'. This column reflects the impact of work settings on salary levels in the data industry.
company_location: The country where the company is located. It helps in analyzing how the location of the company affects salary structures.
company_size: The size of the employer company, often categorized into small (S), medium (M), and large (L) sizes. This allows for analysis of how company size influences salary.
